## BusLineManager

it's a simple viewer that allows you to build bus network lines and run buses, the goal is not just to make the application but to set up the design patterns that we saw during the teaching unit "Advanced design of information systems".

## Installing 

You install this application by cloning the repository "thank you captain obvious ^-^ ".

Next you have to configure the java class path by adding the jar's files inside the lib folder

Then go to SimulationMain class and run it "voilÃ ".

## Patterns implemented 

> Singleton 

> Factory 

> State 

> Observer with the use of flow API

When a edge becomes red it means that a bus is broken-down.
